# Digantra-Assignment
# Question 1:
 # A) High-Level Analytics for a Single Day:

Download and load the dataset (sort-minRange.csv) using Python and Pandas.
Analyze the data to find metrics like the total number of conjunctions or average time of closest approach for a single day.


# B) Conjunctions Data for a Single Satellite:

Pick a satellite using NORAD ID or Object Name and filter the data.
Create visualizations (e.g., line plots) to show the satellite's conjunctions over time.



# Question 2:
Load the entire dataset.
Analyze the dataset for trends and changes over approximately five days.
Use metrics like the total number of conjunctions or specific metrics for a particular satellite over the given timeframe.

Example Metric: Number of conjunctions for NORAD ID 12345 over 7 days:

Filter the data for NORAD ID 12345.
Analyze to find the number of conjunctions over the 7-day period.
Assumptions:
Ensure the data is clean and accurate.
Apply the defined criteria for conjunctions.
Exclude decommissioned or non-functional satellites.
Consider celestial mechanics in your analysis.
Factor in the predetermined response time for operators.
Account for predefined risk tolerance levels.
Be aware of external factors impacting conjunction assessments.
Instructions:
Download Data:

Get "sort-minRange.csv" from CelesTrak.
Tools:

Make sure you have Python, Pandas, Dash, and Plotly installed.
Code Implementation:

Write Python code to load, clean, and analyze the data.
Consider using Dash and Plotly for interactive visualizations.
Documentation:

Document your code clearly, explaining steps and assumptions.
Feel free to seek assistance if you encounter any challenges or have specific questions during the implementation.
